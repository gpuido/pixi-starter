# Pixi Starter

A boilerplate starter project for using Pixi JS with Rollup to produce a small tree-shaken bundle.

# Getting started

Run `npm install`

Install gulp `npm install gulp -g`

Run `gulp` to perform a build

from the build folder, fire up a webserver

eg. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

browse to the server URL.

# Next Steps for this repo

- Watching / serving via browser sync
- Minification with sourcemaps of the rollup output
- Configurable image compression on build
- ES6 the main.js demo code
